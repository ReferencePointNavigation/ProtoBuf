# Protocol Buffer Definitions

This repository contains the [Protocol Buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) definitions for the Reference Point Navigation system for Visually Impaired people.

These definitions form the backbone of the original Navatar app and the first version of the Reference Point implementation.

The root directory contains the expanded definitions for use in the second version of the Reference Point Navigation system.
