# Protocol Buffer Definitions

This repository contains the [Protocol Buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) definitions for the Reference Point Navigation system for Visually Impaired people.

The `proto2` directory contains all of the original definitions in version 2 of the Protocol Buffer format. These definitions form the backbone of the original Navatar app and the first version of the Reference Point implementation.

The directory `proto3` contains the expanded definitions for use in the second version of the Reference Point Navigation system.
